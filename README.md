# Genetic-Algorithm-For-Feature-Reduction

This code is not optimized and can be improved. Give feedback at nccvector@gmail if you find a bug or want more optimizations. I did not have enough time to optimize and test it thoroughly.

One way, i believe you can boost the speed, by loading data directly instead of using pytorch's data loaders. But i will leave that to you :')
I have already started new projects...will comeback to this only if it has any serious problem

You can change the classifier from neural network to KNN, LDA, SVM or any other(if you know how to).
I have done it with KNN already, which was very fast, but decided to redo it with Neural network just to feed my curiosity
